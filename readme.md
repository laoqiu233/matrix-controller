# Matrix Controller
A Python I2C wrapper for the [Matrix Robotics Servo/Motors Controller](https://matrixrobotics.com/).
Matrix Robotic Controller is a very easy to use i2c servo/motor
controller, and this wrapper can deal with all the i2c stuff
behind the scenes so you can just focus on writing the important code.

This script is written in Python, which means you can connect the controller to a
Raspberry Pi instead of a LEGO EV3. *(BTW this is why I wrote this script in the
first place)*
